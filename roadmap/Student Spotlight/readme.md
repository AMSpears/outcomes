# Outcomes Student Spotlight       

The Student Spotlight is a fantastic Opportunity for you to show off your talents and how far you have come. Employers have been anxiously awaiting this opportunity to come see your portfolios!

Required:

* Portfolio

* 60 copies of your resume

* 2 minute elevator pitch

* Clean your desktop and bookmarks

Please do not reach out to anyone before the spotlight, we will give you a list of everyone that attended after the event for you to follow up with!

**Run of Show:**

You will be stationed at your own tables. Think of it as a reverse career fair. Employers will be the ones walking around to get to know you, see your portfolios, and find relevant talent for openings within their organizations. It’s open house style so employers will come and go and there will likely be waves of people. You will be doing a lot of talking!!!!

**Some house cleaning items and etiquette/best practices:**

* GET SOME SLEEP & Drink extra water the day before! Make sure to eat a good meal beforehand. All jokes aside, get some rest so you can present your best self.

* Be early! You are to arrive 1 hour prior to the Event Start Time for setup and pep talk. If you are late you will forfeit your spot.

* You will be choosing your spot, and early bird gets the worm :)

* Make sure your Portfolio is 100% complete. You cannot participate if your portfolio is not done.

* Make sure your [GA Profile](https://profiles.generalassemb.ly/) is published and perfect!!

* Charge your laptop - Make sure you come with a full charge.

* Clean your desktop. Move any unnecessary files and folders.

* Clean your browser. Hide your bookmarks bar and keep one tab open for your portfolio. (Multiple tabs are fine if you have each of your projects on there)

* Clean your actual computer. We have screen cleaners and Lysol wipes at the front desk.

* Bring business cards if you have them.

* Bring 60 printed resumes. You never know when you can hand it out! We will not be able to print them here!!

* Bring something to take notes on and figure out a system that works for you to track the people you meet. Remember, you will need to follow up with EVERY contact you make. It's always nice to reference discussion points in your follow up email. (We will provide you with every attendee's email afterwards as well.)

* Be inclusive during the event. It's important to make sure no one is left waiting to talk to you. Invite them to join the conversations you are already having. It would not be uncommon for people from multiple organizations gathering around your station to hear what you have to say.

* Dress nicely but be comfy. You don't need to go suit & tie, but try to stay away from crazy t-shirts. Remember you will be standing for 2.5 hours.

* GA will be providing you with a bottled water and pizza afterwards.

* Be prepared to speak up and make eye contact...this is  YOUR show!

**Be prepared with your 2 Minute Elevator Pitch!**

You want to be prepared to provide a brief overview of who you are, what you graduated from, your project, and what you hope to accomplish in your next job.  

**_Example:_**

Hi!  My name is NAME!  I just graduated the X GA Immersive and really enjoyed learning about X.  My background is X.  The Project that you see here today is X and essentially it tackles X.  My goal in my next opportunity is X.  I am so thrilled you stopped by!  Thank you so much EMPLOYER NAME!

Practice your pitch at least 10 times the day before.  Be sure you sound calm, confident, and sincere.  Practice enunciating your words, speaking up and making eye contact. Take out the filler word ("*Aum, Like, Well, So, Uh", etc)  *
