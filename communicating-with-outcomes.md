## Communication
* Bring questions you have to your outcomes sessions, almost always you will have some time at the end to talk with Joy or Sarah. 
* If you’d like to meet with us individually, sign up for our office hours with [Joy here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUhjY1U5MFVhS1YzfGRlZmF1bHR8YzI3Yzc5YjBjMzBkYTBhZTY1MDFlY2U1ZjQwZWNmYmI) and [Sarah here.](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UU51a0hzZWhMYWEzfGRlZmF1bHR8OTdmMmNjZTAxMmY2ZTliNzlkMjY1MmExZWE0ZTZiYTY) If you don’t see a time that works for you slack us and we will make the time for you. We love talking with you and working with you, so don’t be shy! 
* If you slack or email us, please give us 24 hours to respond. We work with about 100 students at a time and want to be sure to give your question the attention it deserves. 
* Please do not just drop by without a meeting unless it’s an emergency.
