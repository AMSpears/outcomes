# How to Submit your HW 

After worksheets, we'll be using github to submit all HW:

1. If you haven't already, accept the invitation to the ga-dc-outcomes private repo. We don't want your drafts out in the world, so in order to submit your HW you need to be added to the private repo 

2. Look in your class calendar for the HW due that week on Monday at 6 pm. The HW listed is the HW that's due that day 

3. Click on the link that says "submit an issue here" 

4. At the top of the page, click on the "Issue" Navigation item (next to < > Code) 

5. Click on "New Issue" (Green button on the right hand side) 

6. Submit your HW and name your issue Cohort# Firstname Lastname
